### My Process 

-- At first I  have create header. I made header responsive by adding padding in percentage.

-- Then I create Hero Section by using display :flex.

-- To make protfolio section scrollable I have  make outer section position:relative
and inner div width:fit content and scroll:auto.
 this was little tricky for me.
